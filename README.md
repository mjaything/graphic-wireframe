# Graphic Wireframe Representation Program
This project is about creating a simplified 3D graphic representation of a relief landscape. The 3D representation of a landscape is a critical aspect of modern mapping. This project has allowed me to learn how to place points in space, how to join them with segments and how to observe the scene from a particular viewpoint.

This project uses the graphic library [miniLibX](minilibx_macos). Developed by [42](https://www.42.fr/), it allows users to open a window, light a pixel, and deal with keyboard and mouse.

_Note_: The miniLibX library is primarily built for MacOS. In order to use it on Linux, please refer to [here](https://github.com/ttshivhula/minilibx).
